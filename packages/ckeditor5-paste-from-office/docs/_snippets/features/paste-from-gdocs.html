	<p>Goodle Docs is an online word processing solution released in 2006 as a part of the Google Drive service. There are also applications available for Android iOS, Windows, Blackberry and Chrome OS.</p>
	<p>Due to the non-commercial nature of Google Docs, the software became popular as a budget solution and replacement for Microsoft Office applications. The easy access and availability (a browser with an internet connection is all that is needed) also added to the popularity of the suite.</p>
